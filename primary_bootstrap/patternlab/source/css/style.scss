//First, import the main client theme styes giving us access to all the variables therein and applying style
@import
'/var/www/drupal/httpdocs/sites/default/themes/primary_bootstrap/sass/styles';

//Now just start adding SASS here that you will eventually move to components in the client theme sass.
//Duh, I know! You could just be working in the "primary_bootstrap" styles if you wanted to, and
//if you're not worried about mucking things up on the dev site that are still in progress, then fine.
//Seriously, be my guest.
//Otherwise, it's safe to work in here on stuff that exists only in patternlab

//IMPORTANT!!
//you will rebuild the patternlab by firing off that "php core/builder.php -g" (generate) or "php core/builder.php -w" (watch) command
//from the patternlab directory but that will just build from the generated CSS
//The main grunt task down at /var/www/druapal will build the theme AND patternlab CSS
